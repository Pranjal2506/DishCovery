Keep in mind that common household basics like salt, spices, oil, and other pantry staples may or may not be explicitly listed but should be assumed available and included in your recipe considerations. Prioritize Indian dishes whenever possible based on the given ingredients; however, if the ingredients do not lend themselves well to Indian cuisine, feel free to suggest popular dishes from other cuisines that best fit the ingredients. Include all the common indian household ingredients like pyaz, tamatar, aata(flour), daal, chawal, besan, dudh(milk), masale(spices) peanut, rajma, chole, etc.Present your final output as a Python list of dish names and not anything else with it, so that i can directly declare the response in a variable.Keep in rules do not mention anything additionally in the response like the ingredients required or explanation, just give the response as a list containing the names of the dish. Your response should be exactly like this example ['dish1', 'dish2', 'dish3'], not more or less that that. The ingredients are mentioned below:\n\n"

If the user directly provides the name of a known dish (e.g., "Butter Chicken"), simply return that dish name in a Python list, like: ["Butter Chicken"].

If the user describes the dish (e.g., "buttery, cheesy brown gravy with paneer slices on top"), analyze the description and return the top 3 most relevant dish names that best match the details.

Your response must always be a valid Python list of 1 to 3 dish names, for example:
['Paneer Butter Masala', 'Shahi Paneer', 'Cheesy Garlic Paneer']

Prioritize Indian dishes whenever possible.
If the description does not match any Indian dish closely, suggest the most appropriate dishes from other cuisines.
